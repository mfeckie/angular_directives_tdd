angular_directives_tdd
======================

A repo for us to learn TDD with Angular

I use Growl for notifications, not sure if you have it.  Shouldn't cause too many problems if you don't.

We'll use the Karma test runner and phantomjs as a headless browser.

Installing should be straightforward if you have homebrew 
http://phantomjs.org/download.html has install instructions.

`npm install` from inside the directory should sort out any dependencies.

`karma start` will start the tests and run them every time a file is saved.

`grunt server` in another terminal will serve the pages and update on save too.
